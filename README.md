# Code Dojo 21
This is my worked example from the 21st meeting of the London Code Dojo. Feel free to play around with it. A [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) implementation can be found in the [coffee](coffee) folder.

The tests can be run from the command-line with:

  > npm test

and the tests can be run continuously on changes with:

  > npm run watch

The kata is the 'sorting random-numbers' kata, as follows:

## Kata: Sorta
The objective is to produce a sorted list of numbers, chosen at random from a range of 1..256

Yes, it's that simple. Use git, use TDD and try and avoid the use of mice, trackballs, trackpads etc. i.e. work those keyboard-shortcuts!

No, using List.sort or equivalent is cheating, choose and implement your own sort algorithm.

## Kata: pomodoro 2
The customer forgot to mention, they require 100,000 of these numbers, chosen from a list of 1..2^16, and only prime numbers are allowed.

## Kata: pomodoro 3
The customer's business is booming, we need 10 million of these numbers, pronto! And chosen from a list of primes in the range 1..2^32
